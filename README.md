### Speech recognition and recommendation system:
Increasing linguistic vocabulary and pronunciation with the help of AI


# Description:
Database generated using OpenAI API and divided into 5 levels based on difficulty.
For each word in the vocabulary we generated a sentence and converted it into audio. 
The idea of the project is to let the user listen to the sentences and repeat them.
After that, the user will get the accuracy score based on his input and recommend the other sentence to practice based on the mistakes he made.


For installing the virtual environment you can either use the Makefile and run make setup or install it manually with the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt
