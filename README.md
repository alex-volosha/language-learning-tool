### ISP_International_Speech_Project
Increasing linguistic vocabulary with AI

# Description:
We have vocabulary database divided into 5 levels based on difficulty.
For each word in the vocabulary we generated a sentence and converted it into audio. 
The idea of the project is to let the user listen to the chain of word+translation+sentence and repeat it using a microphone.
After that, the user will get the accuracy score based on his input.


For installing the virtual environment you can either use the Makefile and run make setup or install it manually with the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt
